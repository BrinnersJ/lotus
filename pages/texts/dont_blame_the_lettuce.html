        <h2>Don't Blame the Lettuce</h2>
        <p><em>Thich Nhat Nanh</em></p>
        <br>
<p>
    When you plant a lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce.
<br>You look for reasons it is not doing well.
<br>It may need fertiliser, or more water, or less sun.
<br>
<br>You never blame the lettuce.
<br>
<br>Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person.
<br>But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce.
<br>
<br>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument.
<br>That is my experience.  No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding.
<br>
<br>If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.
</P>
