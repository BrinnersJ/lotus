        <h2>A Precious Human Life</h2>
        <p><em>HH 14<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama</em></p>
        <br>
<p>
    Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive.
<br>I have a precious human life,
<br>I am not going to waste it.
<br>I am going to use all my energies to develop myself,
<br>to expand my heart out to others;
<br>to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
<br>
<br>I am going to have kind thoughts towards others,
<br>I am not going to get angry or think badly about others.
<br>
<br>I am going to benefit others as much as I can.
</P>
